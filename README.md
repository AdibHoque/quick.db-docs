#### What is Quick.db?

> Quick.db is an easy to use database alternative, it was designed to be simple to let new users who are just getting into development not need  to worry about large-scale databases.
>
> It works by storing data to a set **ID**_\(key\)_, then access that persistent data anytime through a .fetch\(\) function.  
> You can think of it like putting data\(objects\) in boxes, then the label that box has on it being the **ID**. You can then find the box you are looking for just my pointing to its **ID**_\(label on the box\)_.
